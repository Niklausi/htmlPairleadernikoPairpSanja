    <h2>GIMME SHELTER SONGTEXT </h2>
<p>Ooh, a storm is threatening
My very life today
If I don′t get some shelter
Ooh yeah I'm gonna fade away</p>
<br>

War, children
It′s just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away
It′s just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin′
Our streets today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost its way


War, children
It's just a shot away
It′s just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away
It′s just a shot away

Rape, murder, it's just a shot away
It′s just a shot away
Rape, murder, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it′s just a shot away
It′s just a shot away

Mmm, a flood is threatening
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It′s just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It′s just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It′s just a shot away

I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It′s just a kiss away
It′s just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away
