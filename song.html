    <br>
<p>Ooh, a storm is threatening<br>
My very life today<br>
If I don′t get some shelter<br>
Ooh yeah I'm gonna fade away</p>
<br>

War, children<br>
It′s just a shot away<br>
It's just a shot away<br>
War, children<br>
It's just a shot away<br>
It′s just a shot away<br>

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin′<br>
Our streets today<br>
Burns like a red coal carpet<br>
Mad bull lost its way<br>


War, children<br>
It's just a shot away<br>
It′s just a shot away<br>
War, children<br>
It's just a shot away<br>
It′s just a shot away<br><br>

Rape, murder, it's just a shot away<br>
It′s just a shot away<br>
Rape, murder, yeah, it's just a shot away<br>
It's just a shot away<br>
Rape, murder, it′s just a shot away<br>
It′s just a shot away<br><br>

Mmm, a flood is threatening<br>
My very life today<br>
Gimme, gimme shelter<br>
Or I'm gonna fade away<br><br>

War, children<br>
It′s just a shot away<br>
It's just a shot away<br>
It′s just a shot away<br>
It's just a shot away<br>
It′s just a shot away<br><br>

I tell you love, sister<br>
It's just a kiss away<br>
It's just a kiss away<br>
It′s just a kiss away<br>
It′s just a kiss away<br>
It's just a kiss away<br>
Kiss away, kiss away<br><br>
